# Getting Started with Create React App

 - user must set name before they can fill the form
 - work on changing endpoints when hosted:
 - prevent calling api of state didn't change.


## New flow
- ### STOCKS/Rolls
- Only Admin should be able to fill up stocks/Rolls. (Though it can be visible to everyone).
- Stock/Rolls should have indexing according to an array method
   - Stock 1, Date in (date bought), kg (kg when bought), metre run (total metre that was measured when inputted)
- They can fill as much rolls as they want which will be indexed automatically.
- Active stock should be at the top of the page


 # Api func Check.
 - Login works.
 - admin@demo.com, demo


## Things to fix.
- signing out has fault
- fixing sales and stocks to work
- fixing the account/profile section
- accounts should only show for admin
- admin can create an account
- delete an account
- modify account password
- logout api call.
- date format to appropriate
- sorting by date
- user can't add sales or stocks till name is filled
- set up confirmation of uploads as they cant't be changed afterwards.
- picture should be uploadable
- forgot password
- sending email with laravel
